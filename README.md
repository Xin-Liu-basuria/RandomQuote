   **Example in plain text**:

Every quote consists of "default content","alternative content" and "its resources"

Among those, ONLY "default content" is must.

_Every part should have a **empty line** as interval as you see_

This order can't be changed.

Each part is symbolized by the point list in markdown but Mention: ONLY use "*"

For "alternate content",you should use italic to symbolize it but please use "_" only

For "its resources", you should use bold to symbolize it and also like above
